# Advent of code 2022
This repo contains my attempted solutions for the advent of code 2022 event.

## Tech
Will attempt to solve AoC with c this time around and learn the language a bit. Let's see if it lasts all the way.

## Dirs
You can find the data for each day in the dir `data`, each data file labelled by day. The example inputs are included.

The solution source can be found in the dir `src`, each of which is also labelled by day.
