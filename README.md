# Advent of code 2022
This repo contains my attempted solutions for the advent of code 2022 event.

## Tech
Will attempt to solve AoC with c this time around and learn the language a bit.

## Dirs
You can find the data for each day in the dir `data`, each data file labelled by day. The example inputs are included.

The solution source can be found in the dir `src`, each of which is also labelled by day.

In the `util` dir various data structures, utility classes etc can be found.

## Notes
For day 1 through 10 each solution is in a folder and file with it's own main method.
For day 11 forward, the solutions are directly in the src dir with an h and c file for each day and are executed by the 'main.c' file.
